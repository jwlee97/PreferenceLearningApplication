# PreferenceLearningApplication

## Preamble
This toolkit was developed for the dissertation, 'A model-based design tool for 3D GUI layout design that accommodates user attributes' submitted in 2021 for the 
MPhil in Machine Learning & Machine Intelligence program at the University of Cambridge.

## Definitions
**Color Harmony**: Range of colors with similar hues on the HSV scale. <br />
**Colorfulness**: Measure based on the amount of coloration in the users' environment. <br />
**Edgeness**: Measure based on the amount of 'busyness' in the users' environment. <br />
**Fitts' Law**: Average movement time to each UI panel as a function of index of difficulty. <br />
**Consumed Endurance**: Severity of upper-arm fatigue from prolonged arm use. <br />
**Muscle Activation**: Muscle activation of the upper arms. <br />
**RULA**: Amount of 'risk' associated with the current arm posture. <br />
**Cognitive Load**: Measure of the usersâ€™ workload or cognitive usage. <br />

## Instructions
In test.py, change the image file, panel sizes, and objective function weights in main() to adjust the UI layout.
At each iteration, choose the preferred UI layout - this will become the 'preference' image for the next iteration, and the application will suggest a new layout as the 'suggestion'.
The 'preference' image for the first iteration will be the output of weighted sum optimization in UIoptimization.py using the function weights specified.
When finished, press 'quit'. The script will display the optimized UI layout when finished, and output the optimal locations of each panel in world coordinates.
